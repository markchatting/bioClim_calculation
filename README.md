Calculates USGS bioclimatic predictors from temperature and precipitation data

These bioclimatic predictors were developed by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and full descriptions are available on: https://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/691/ds691.pdf. These predictors are used in many ecological applications, for example species distribution modelling.
